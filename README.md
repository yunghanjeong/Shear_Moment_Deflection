## Project Statement

It is often said that the trucks are the bloodline of America and as the world pushes for greener transportation many have pushed for more efficient methods of logistical transporation. To achieve higher efficiency set by many new legal guidelines the desire for more accurate tracking, measuring, and managing large tractor trailer has been fastly growing. This prototpye was envisioned to track the trailor's weight and load distribution and provide live statistics to the managing company via bluetooth and satelite communication.
